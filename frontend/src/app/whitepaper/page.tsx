            <p>
              MetaWill is a decentralized platform built on blockchain
              technology that enables users to create and fulfill personal
              commitments with financial accountability. Users stake Ethereum as
              collateral for their promises, which is either returned upon
              successful completion or donated to charity if the commitment is
              not fulfilled. The platform leverages smart contracts to ensure
              transparency and trustless verification through a validator
              system.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">1.1 Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            People often struggle to follow through on personal commitments and
            goals. Traditional methods lack accountability mechanisms that are
            both effective and transparent. Current solutions either rely on
            trust-based systems or centralized authorities, which can be
            manipulated or compromised.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">1.2 Solution Overview</h3>
          <p>
            MetaWill provides a decentralized commitment platform where users
            can:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Create public commitments with financial stakes</li>
            <li>Set their own deadlines</li>
            <li>Assign trusted validators</li>
            <li>Receive verification of completion</li>
            <li>
              Automatically handle the financial consequences of success or
              failure
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The platform uses blockchain technology to ensure transparency,
            immutability, and trustless execution of the commitment process.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">
            2. Platform Architecture
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">2.1 Technical Stack</h3>
          <p>
            MetaWill is built on the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing smart
            contracts written in Solidity. The frontend is developed using React
            with Web3 integration via RainbowKit for wallet connections. The
            platform employs a serverless architecture with blockchain as the
            primary data store.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">
            2.2 Smart Contract System
          </h3>
          <p>
            The core of MetaWill consists of several interconnected smart
            contracts:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>CommitmentFactory:</strong> Creates and manages individual
              commitment contracts
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Commitment:</strong> Holds staked funds and manages the
              validation process
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ValidationRegistry:</strong> Tracks validator reputation
              and history
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DonationRouter:</strong> Handles the routing of failed
              commitment stakes to charities
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Core Features</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">
            3.1 Wallet-Based Authentication
          </h3>
          <p>
            Users connect their Ethereum wallet to access the platform. This
            provides a secure, passwordless authentication system where the
            wallet address serves as the user's unique identifier. MetaWill
            supports multiple wallet providers through RainbowKit integration.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">3.2 Commitment Creation</h3>
          <p>Users can create detailed commitments by specifying:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>A clear description of what they are committing to do</li>
            <li>The amount of ETH they wish to stake</li>
            <li>A deadline for completion</li>
            <li>The address of their chosen validator</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Upon confirmation, a smart contract is deployed to the Ethereum
            blockchain, and the staked funds are transferred to this contract.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">3.3 Validator Selection</h3>
          <p>
            Each commitment requires a validatorâ€”an external Ethereum address
            designated to verify the completion of the commitment. Validators
            are notified of their selection and are responsible for confirming
            or disputing the user's claim of completion.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">
            3.4 Financial Staking Mechanism
          </h3>
          <p>
            Users lock ETH as collateral for their commitment. This creates a
            financial incentive to follow through on their promises. The
            platform enforces minimum and maximum stake limits to ensure
            meaningful stakes while preventing excessive risk.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">
            3.5 Commitment Validation Process
          </h3>
          <p>The validation process involves two parties:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>
              The user self-reports whether they have completed their commitment
            </li>
            <li>The validator confirms or disputes the user's claim</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If both parties agree on success, the staked funds are returned to
            the user. If either party reports failure, the funds are sent to the
            designated charity.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">3.6 Outcome Processing</h3>
          <p>
            The smart contract automatically processes the outcome based on the
            consensus between the user and validator:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Success:</strong> Staked ETH is returned to the user
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Failure:</strong> Staked ETH is transferred to the
              donation address
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a
            transparent and immutable record of outcomes.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">3.7 Donation Mechanism</h3>
          <p>
            Failed commitments result in donations to predefined charity
            addresses. This creates a positive social impact even from
            unfulfilled promises. The platform provides transparent tracking of
            all donations and generates receipts for users.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. User Experience</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3">4.1 User Dashboard</h3>
          <p>
            The dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of their
            commitments, including:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
            <li>Active commitments with progress tracking</li>
            <li>Past commitment history and outcomes</li>
            <li>
              Validation requests for commitments where they are the validator
            </li>
            <li>Financial summary (total staked, returned, and donated)</li>
